About Sravya (use the most relevant 1-2 details for THIS company, not all):
- ${CANDIDATE.degree} at UIC (University of Illinois Chicago)
- 2 years at Mercedes-Benz R&D: distributed data pipelines, vehicle telemetry, Kafka/Spark, 500GB+/day
- Current: LLM/RAG research at UIC Cancer Center — clinical data extraction
- Skills: Python, Java, TypeScript, React, Node.js, AWS, Kafka, Spark
- Website: ${CANDIDATE.website}
- Seeking: ${CANDIDATE.seeking}

The audience is a ${audienceMode}.

Hard rules — FOLLOW EXACTLY:
1. NEVER use these openers: "I'm a CS student interested in opportunities", "I hope this email finds you well", "I came across your profile and wanted to connect", "I'd love to chat for 15 minutes". Auto-deleted.
2. NEVER use generic subject lines. Forbidden: "Internship inquiry", "Quick question", "Reaching out". Use formats:
   - "Mercedes-Benz pipelines → your data infra at ${companyName}?"
   - "Built RAG over clinical data — interested in your [team]"
   - "Master's CS + Kafka/Spark — open to a 5-min chat at ${companyName}?"
3. Open with ONE specific hook. Pick the angle that maps best to ${companyName}:
   - Data/infra company → Mercedes-Benz pipeline work
   - AI/ML/healthtech → Cancer Center RAG research
   - Quant/finance → systems + reliability angle
   - Startup → product velocity + full-stack range
4. Body structure (4-5 sentences total):
   (a) Specific hook tied to their team/product/recipient's work
   (b) ONE relevant credential — quote a specific achievement, not generic skills
   (c) Clear ask — referral / intro / 5-min chat. Pick one.
   (d) Sign-off as Sravya
5. Length: 4-6 sentences MAX including sign-off. Cut anything extra.
6. Voice: confident engineer, not eager candidate. No hedging ("just wanted to", "if it's not too much trouble").
7. Use the recipient's first name only. Don't pad with their title.

Return ONLY valid JSON: { "subject": "...", "body": "..." }`;

4. ONE clear ask — referral / intro / advice. Pick one.
