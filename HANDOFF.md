- Frontend repo: `/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS CODE/email tracker` (branch: `main`)
- Backend worktree: `/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS CODE/outreach-local` (branch: `phase-4-pg` — VM tracks this)
- Repo: `https://github.com/Sravya1802/outreach-os` (PUBLIC — flagged in memory: still has historical PII commits, recommend rewriting history or going private)

## Accounts

- **`lakshmisravyar@gmail.com`** (UUID `70df2946-a46e-4b63-832c-2822cda4cf4b`) — owns ALL existing production data: 1499 companies, 36 job_contacts (14 with email), 2 evaluations, resume text, 6 role-archetype PDFs in `/home/ubuntu/outreach/resumes/`.
- **`rls180202@gmail.com`** (UUID `459b9b5b-1f86-48cf-9b8a-98e7a4fb4c5d`) — empty / clean-slate account.
- Per-user isolation is enforced — each account sees ONLY its own data via RLS + backend `WHERE user_id = req.user.id` on every query.

## Migrations applied to Supabase

- `001_init.sql` (legacy)
- `002_backend_schema.sql` — full canonical schema (13 tables + indexes + RLS + storage)
- `003_per_user_isolation.sql` — added `user_id UUID DEFAULT <founder>` to every table, backfilled, swapped RLS to `user_id = auth.uid()`
- `004_user_id_not_null.sql` — tightened user_id NOT NULL (kept DEFAULT for cron paths)

## Known gaps & open work

### Pending — needs my input or has an unfixed bug
1. **Outreach CRM "0 contacts"** — code fix is committed (`8a55549`) so `/outreach` now calls the JWT-attaching API wrapper. After Vercel deploy, verify as `lakshmisravyar@gmail.com` that `/outreach` shows 36 contacts (14 with email). If still empty, check Settings page → red Account box and DevTools Network `all-contacts` `Authorization` header.
2. ~~**Email + DM templates**~~ — implemented in the current uncommitted stabilization pass: `/outreach/templates` is now an editable per-user template UI, backend stores templates in `meta.outreach_templates`, and `generate` routes pass saved templates into the AI prompt as style anchors.
3. **Role Eligibility / Ranked Roles loading bug** — hardened again in frontend `6f84fda`: `/apply/ranked` now has a visible error/retry state and normalizes non-string `fit_assessment` values before rendering. Vercel route returns HTTP 200. Browser-verify while logged in; if it still fails, capture the rendered error or DevTools Console.
4. ~~**Sign in / Sign up UI**~~ — implemented in the current uncommitted stabilization pass: Login now has Sign in / Sign up tabs, with magic link kept as a secondary sign-in option.
5. **"Email rate limit exceeded" on magic link** — Supabase auth config issue, not code.
6. **Audit follow-ups** — current CI e2e is green on `main` (`24980521017`): **25 passed / 4 skipped** before this pass. Newly verified by default: combined Companies + Auto Apply queue filters, authenticated privacy export + sensitive-profile dry-run, render smoke, mobile smoke, and protected unauth API rejection. As of the 2026-04-27 fixture-seeding pass: `scripts/seed-e2e-fixtures.mjs` runs in CI before Playwright and creates a `jobs` row + queued auto-apply evaluation against a fresh Greenhouse URL, so the application-tracking Save and `E2E_AUTO_APPLY_EVAL_ID` Auto Apply dry-run gates run automatically once `SUPABASE_URL`+`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are added to GitHub Actions secrets. `E2E_RUN_REAL_APIFY` is now opt-in via either the workflow_dispatch `run_real_apify` checkbox or repo variable. Two-user isolation remains intentionally skipped per user decision.

### Deferred / acknowledged
- Apify actor quota/key can still block LinkedIn/Wellfound/Google Jobs scrapers even when `/api/health` says `has_apify: true`; latest frontend `6f84fda` refreshes `/credits/status?refresh=true` after scrape failures so the sidebar status should turn red/critical quickly. If actors keep returning 0 or quota errors, fix is Apify account/quota/actor choice, not only app code.
- ~~"Apify status card should turn red when limit hit"~~ — fixed in frontend `346c0b2` and backend `f929862`; VM deployed and public health check passed on 2026-04-25.
- ~~"Top Companies filter on Companies page is broken"~~ — fixed in frontend `463f756` + backend `86eaeed` (server-side sort + source/status filters); VM deployed through `d0016ee`.
- ~~"Companies page shows 0/loading first then populates"~~ — fixed in `7f42c6d`; tightened in `4584276`; final UX fix in `0b59c6d` uses per-user sessionStorage cache + parent stats snapshot so the page paints last known counts immediately and refreshes silently.
- ~~"Job Scraper source buttons show 'no companies found'"~~ — fixed in frontend `4584276` + backend `d0016ee`; per-source scrapes now hit canonical `/jobs/scrape` and backend accepts selected sources.
- ~~"Don't pre-load resume in Career Ops Evaluate"~~ — fixed in `6cf20ad` (Resume section now only renders on Auto-Apply Setup tab or when user has no resume).
- ~~"Job Dashboard slow to load"~~ — improved in `c2eabdb` (stale-while-revalidate sessionStorage cache, 5min TTL; instant first paint on revisit, background refresh).

### Architectural follow-ups (no urgency)
- Migration 005 to drop `user_id DEFAULT` after fixing 5 TODO(auth) markers in cron/startup paths (server.js daily refresh, jobs.js runReclassifyUnclassified, autoApplier comment).
- "System user" concept for background paths that genuinely have no request context.
- ~~Schema follow-up: replace global UNIQUE constraints with per-user uniqueness~~ — fixed in backend `5cce7a7`; migrations `005_per_user_uniqueness.sql` + `006_auto_apply_safety_profile.sql` applied on Supabase through the VM on 2026-04-26.

## How I work

- Auto mode: usually ON — execute autonomously on low-risk work. Off for big architectural calls.
- Memory rules I've internalized:
  - **No Claude attribution** in commits / PR bodies / code (no `Co-Authored-By`, no 🤖 footers).
  - **Disambiguate ambiguous "yes"/"go"** on multi-option prompts before acting on destructive branches.
  - **Never `git reset --hard` with a dirty tree** — stash first, always.
- Sandbox blocks: writing credentials to VM .env, force-pushing to main, broad credential probes. I ask before those.

## What's likely next

If the session resumes my work as of this snapshot:
1. **Browser-verify** after hard refresh: `/apply/ranked`, `/apply/auto-apply` Setup/Queue/Completed/History, `/discover/scraper`, `/discover/companies`, `/outreach`, and mobile sidebar layout.
2. **Auto Apply setup action:** open Career Ops / Auto-Apply Setup, review the expanded profile fields, explicitly check Auto Apply consent, save, then preview/queue. Backend now refuses queue/run without consent.
3. **Convert the remaining optional e2e skips to full verification:** seed one company row for the e2e user, set `E2E_AUTO_APPLY_EVAL_ID` to a queued supported-ATS evaluation with consent/resume, and only set `E2E_RUN_REAL_APIFY=1` when you intentionally want to spend Apify quota. Do not chase the second-user e2e skip unless the user reverses the decision; they chose to skip it.
4. **Apify reality check:** retry scrapers and watch sidebar API Status. If Apify turns red or sources still return quota/no-data results, check Apify console actor limits and upgrade/swap actors.
5. **Quick wins left:** Supabase magic-link rate-limit config and any browser-verified regressions.

Confirm you can read `~/.claude/projects/-Users-lakshmisravyarachakonda-VS-CODE-email-tracker/memory/MEMORY.md` and the auto-loaded memory files, then ask me which item I want to start with.

## Session log

### 2026-04-27 — Deep-audit fixtures executing in CI: 26/29 passing, captcha fix pending VM deploy
- **What:** Wired the new fixture-seeding pipeline through end-to-end and ran it twice. Steps in this pass:
  1. Set GitHub secrets `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (piped from local `.env` via `gh secret set`, never echoed). First e2e run (`24981729769`) failed at the seed step with `Legacy API keys are disabled` — Supabase had disabled the legacy `eyJ…` `service_role` JWT earlier today (same rotation that broke frontend login). User pasted the new `sb_secret_…` key; Python script rewrote `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in both [/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS CODE/email tracker/.env](.env) and [/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS CODE/outreach-local/.env](../outreach-local/.env), then re-set the GitHub secret.
  2. Run `24981938858`: seed step's first PostgREST upsert hit `42P10` (`there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification`) on `user_profile?on_conflict=user_id` because the unique index is partial (`WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL`) — same constraint PR #15 worked around in the backend. Patched the seed script to GET-then-PATCH-or-INSERT the profile manually; jobs/evaluations upserts still use `on_conflict` because their indexes aren't partial.
  3. Run `24982011166`: seed succeeded (`user_id=7f3bbd9b-…`, profile patched, jobs upserted, evaluations row inserted against an Anthropic Greenhouse posting). 26/29 passed; **application-tracking Save flipped from skipped to passing**; the seeded Auto Apply dry-run failed three times with `{ok:false, platform:"greenhouse", error:"Captcha present"}` because the Anthropic board sits behind Cloudflare. Real Apify still skipped (intentional).
  4. Two-pronged fix for the captcha case: backend semantic fix (`autoApplier.js` now returns `needsReview: true` on both captcha and login walls — they're user-fixable states, parallel to profile-incomplete and unfilled-required) and seed script reorders the default boards list so it tries `gitlab,1password,duolingo,instacart,dropbox,robinhood` before Cloudflare-fronted boards.
- **Files:** [scripts/seed-e2e-fixtures.mjs:55](scripts/seed-e2e-fixtures.mjs#L55), [scripts/seed-e2e-fixtures.mjs:107](scripts/seed-e2e-fixtures.mjs#L107), [.env:1](.env#L1), [../outreach-local/.env:1](../outreach-local/.env#L1), [../outreach-local/backend/services/autoApplier.js:355](../outreach-local/backend/services/autoApplier.js#L355), GitHub Actions secrets `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (set 2026-04-27 07:17:14Z and 07:17:18Z, then `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` rotated again 07:24Z to the `sb_secret_…` value).
- **Status:** frontend `main` at `fa6e4c0` (seed picker reorder); backend `phase-4-pg` at `39b8992` (captcha/login `needsReview`); **VM still on backend `8005128`** — sandbox blocks SSH deploy without explicit auth, so the captcha fix is not live yet. With current prod code, the dry-run will keep failing whenever the picked Greenhouse URL gates with a captcha; the seed picker reorder should make that less frequent but doesn't eliminate it.
- **Follow-up:** (1) **User runs `ssh -t ubuntu@140.245.15.56 'sudo bash /home/ubuntu/outreach/deploy/update.sh'`** to ship `39b8992`. (2) Re-trigger e2e via `gh workflow run e2e` (or paste "deployed" in chat and I'll trigger + watch). Expected: 27/29 passing — the seeded Auto Apply dry-run flips to passing whenever it hits a captcha (now reported as `needsReview`) or actually fills the form (`dryRun + readyToSubmit`). (3) `E2E_RUN_REAL_APIFY` stays opt-in; flip via `gh workflow run e2e --field run_real_apify=true` when you want to spend Apify quota. (4) Two-user isolation still skipped on purpose.

### 2026-04-27 — Auto-seeded deep-audit fixtures + opt-in real-Apify
- **What:** Closed the three remaining optional deep-audit skips that the user asked to complete (two-user isolation stays skipped per prior decision). Added `scripts/seed-e2e-fixtures.mjs` — an idempotent service-role seeder that, before each Playwright run, picks a fresh Greenhouse posting from a list of stable public boards and upserts: a `user_profile` row with auto_apply_consent + valid first/last/email/phone + `resume_dir` (defaults to the VM's `/home/ubuntu/outreach/resumes`); a per-user `jobs` row for the application-tracking Save gate; and an `evaluations` row with `apply_mode='auto'`, `apply_status='queued'`, `source='e2e_seed'` for the Auto Apply dry-run gate. The seed step writes `eval_id` to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`; the workflow now wires that into `E2E_AUTO_APPLY_EVAL_ID` (with `vars.E2E_AUTO_APPLY_EVAL_ID` as fallback) and the real-Apify gate is opt-in via a new `workflow_dispatch.run_real_apify` boolean (or `vars.E2E_RUN_REAL_APIFY=1`). Skips silently when the new secrets aren't configured so local Playwright runs still work.
- **Files:** [scripts/seed-e2e-fixtures.mjs:1](scripts/seed-e2e-fixtures.mjs#L1), [.github/workflows/e2e.yml:1](.github/workflows/e2e.yml#L1), [.env.example:38](.env.example#L38), [HANDOFF.md:70](HANDOFF.md#L70)
- **Status:** uncommitted on `main`; typecheck clean (74 files), root tests 10/10, workflow YAML parses. Seed runs as a no-op without env (verified locally).
- **Follow-up:** (1) Add `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to GitHub Actions repository secrets (the same values used by `scripts/create-e2e-user.mjs`). (2) Trigger a manual `e2e` run via Actions UI; with the new secrets present, the deep-audit Save + Auto Apply dry-run rows should flip from skipped to passing. (3) When you intentionally want to spend Apify quota, run the workflow with `run_real_apify=true`; otherwise it stays skipped. (4) If the picked Greenhouse URL has many custom required fields, the dry-run will report `needsReview` rather than `dryRun:true` — both satisfy the test assertion. (5) Two-user isolation is still skipped on purpose; reverse only if you decide to run it.

### 2026-04-27 — Deep audit coverage + privacy controls deployed
- **What:** Deepened the remaining production-audit coverage. Auto Apply dry-run now fills supported ATS forms and runs the required-field scan before skipping submit. Bulk queue filters were extracted and unit-tested, Settings gained authenticated export/erase privacy controls, and the prod e2e suite now covers combined filters + privacy export plus optional gates for app-tracking Save, two-user isolation, full Auto Apply dry-run, and real Apify scraping.
- **Files:** [backend/services/autoApplier.js:364](backend/services/autoApplier.js#L364), [backend/services/bulkQueueFilter.js:1](backend/services/bulkQueueFilter.js#L1), [backend/routes/careerOps.js:1146](backend/routes/careerOps.js#L1146), [frontend/src/App.jsx:24](frontend/src/App.jsx#L24), [tests/e2e/deep-audit.spec.js:1](tests/e2e/deep-audit.spec.js#L1), [.github/workflows/e2e.yml:12](.github/workflows/e2e.yml#L12)
- **Status:** frontend/main committed + pushed as `cbdb5cf`; VM backend branch committed + pushed as `8005128`; VM fast-forwarded and PM2 manually restarted after the deploy script hit a `git log` pager; public health OK; unauth `/api/career/privacy/export` correctly returns 401; GitHub e2e run `24980521017` green with 25 passed / 4 intentional skips.
- **Follow-up:** To mark the last partial audit rows as fully verified, add the optional CI inputs named in Known gaps item 6, then rerun `e2e`. Real Apify remains intentionally opt-in because it spends quota.

### 2026-04-27 — Second-user e2e marked non-blocking
- **What:** User chose to skip the second-user write/read isolation e2e path. The test remains available behind optional `E2E_SECOND_TEST_EMAIL` / `E2E_SECOND_TEST_PASSWORD`, but it should be treated as intentionally skipped and non-blocking for the current deployment-readiness checklist.
- **Files:** [HANDOFF.md:70](HANDOFF.md#L70), [HANDOFF.md:100](HANDOFF.md#L100)
- **Status:** documentation-only update on `main`.
- **Follow-up:** Remaining optional verification gates are seeded application-tracking Save, seeded full Auto Apply dry-run, and real Apify scrape under quota.

### 2026-04-27 — GitHub e2e green: 23/23 passing on current main
- **What:** Resolved the `invalid_credentials` block. Recreated the e2e Supabase user `e2e@outreach-os.local` (id `7f3bbd9b-…`) with auto-confirm on, verified password grant works locally with `sb_publishable_…` key (`HTTP/2 200` + `access_token`). CI was still failing with the same creds because the GitHub web-UI paste introduced trailing whitespace into `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD`. Re-set both secrets via `printf '%s' … | gh secret set` for byte-exact values; re-ran e2e — `gh run` `24979149149` finished in 1m9s with **23/23 passed**.
- **Files:** GitHub Actions secrets `E2E_TEST_EMAIL`, `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD` (re-set 2026-04-27 06:02:43Z and 06:02:44Z respectively); no code changes.
- **Status:** main e2e workflow green; all 23 specs (incl. authenticated + mobile) now run and pass.
- **Follow-up:** (a) Rotate the e2e test password because it was disclosed in chat while diagnosing; reset password in Supabase + re-run `gh secret set E2E_TEST_PASSWORD`. (b) Whenever editing GitHub secrets, use `printf '%s' '<value>' | gh secret set <NAME>` instead of the web UI to avoid trailing-newline regressions. (c) Optional cleanup: bump the Node 20 actions (`actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4`) before the June 2026 deprecation.

### ~~2026-04-27 — GitHub e2e current-main run now blocked on invalid test credentials~~ (resolved above)
- **What:** Triggered current-main e2e run `24977765259` after the password-auth workflow fix. The run is on the latest code and `E2E_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is accepted, but setup fails with Supabase `invalid_credentials`, meaning `E2E_TEST_EMAIL` / `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD` are wrong, missing from the target project, or the auth user has no matching password.
- **Files:** GitHub Actions secrets `E2E_TEST_EMAIL`, `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD`, `E2E_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`; [tests/e2e/auth.setup.js](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/tests/e2e/auth.setup.js:32)
- **Status:** no code change; e2e run result: 12 unauth/public tests passed, setup failed, 10 authenticated/mobile specs did not run.
- **Follow-up:** In Supabase Auth users, create or reset the e2e user password, then update GitHub repository secrets `E2E_TEST_EMAIL` and `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD` exactly; rerun `e2e` on latest `main`.

### 2026-04-27 — E2E CI auth switched from refresh token to password grant
- **What:** Fresh GitHub e2e run `24976916697` reached Supabase with the publishable key but failed because `E2E_REFRESH_TOKEN` was invalid/rotated (`refresh_token_not_found`). Updated Playwright setup to prefer `E2E_TEST_EMAIL` + `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD` password grant for CI so each run mints a fresh session; refresh token remains only as local fallback.
- **Files:** [tests/e2e/auth.setup.js](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/tests/e2e/auth.setup.js:32), [tests/e2e/auth-env.js](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/tests/e2e/auth-env.js:8), [.github/workflows/e2e.yml](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/.github/workflows/e2e.yml:6), [.env.example](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/.env.example:35)
- **Status:** committed and pushed to `main` as `698f40a`; local checks pass: root tests 8/8, typecheck/lint clean, local e2e 12 passed / 11 skipped without auth env.
- **Follow-up:** Add GitHub repo secrets `E2E_TEST_EMAIL` and `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD` for the e2e user, keep `E2E_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_...`, then rerun e2e. `E2E_REFRESH_TOKEN` is no longer needed for CI.

### 2026-04-26 — E2E publishable-key secret validation clarified
- **What:** GitHub e2e run failed with `Legacy API keys are disabled`, which means `E2E_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` was missing or set to the old `eyJ...` anon key. Hardened Playwright auth setup to require a trimmed key starting with `sb_publishable_` before calling Supabase, so future failures point directly at the bad secret.
- **Files:** [tests/e2e/auth.setup.js](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/tests/e2e/auth.setup.js:21), [tests/e2e/auth-env.js](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/tests/e2e/auth-env.js:3)
- **Status:** committed and pushed to `main` as `8f147a1`; local checks pass: root tests 8/8, typecheck/lint clean, local e2e 12 passed / 11 skipped without auth env.
- **Follow-up:** In GitHub repository secrets, edit `E2E_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` so the value is the Supabase publishable key beginning `sb_publishable_`, not the legacy anon JWT beginning `eyJ...`; rerun e2e.

### 2026-04-26 — E2E auth harness migrated off legacy Supabase anon JWT
- **What:** Removed the hardcoded legacy JWT anon key from Playwright auth setup and switched e2e session refresh to `E2E_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Added a guard so authenticated specs skip cleanly when local auth env is missing, plus a regression test that fails if source/test config hardcodes JWT-looking API keys.
- **Files:** [tests/e2e/auth.setup.js](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/tests/e2e/auth.setup.js:18), [tests/e2e/auth-env.js](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/tests/e2e/auth-env.js:1), [tests/security-hygiene.test.mjs](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/tests/security-hygiene.test.mjs:1), [.github/workflows/e2e.yml](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/.github/workflows/e2e.yml:11), [.env.example](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/.env.example:32)
- **Status:** committed and pushed to `main` as `0356a4c`; local checks pass: root tests 8/8, backend tests 12/12, typecheck/lint clean, frontend build clean. `npm run test:e2e` outside sandbox passes 12 unauth/public checks and skips 11 authenticated/mobile specs because this machine lacks `E2E_REFRESH_TOKEN` + `E2E_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.
- **Follow-up:** Add `E2E_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_...` to GitHub repo secrets alongside `E2E_REFRESH_TOKEN`, then rerun full e2e to convert authenticated/mobile rows from skipped/unverified to verified.

### 2026-04-26 — Supabase legacy API-key disable broke login; publishable-key migration started
- **What:** After legacy JWT-based Supabase API keys were disabled, OutreachOS login showed `Legacy API keys are disabled` because Vercel still had `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` set to the old JWT `anon` key. User updated Vercel to use the new `sb_publishable_...` key.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/supabaseClient.js](/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/VS%20CODE/email%20tracker/frontend/src/supabaseClient.js:6), Vercel env var `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, Supabase Settings → API Keys
- **Status:** dashboard/env change by user; repo unchanged except this handoff entry; browser verification pending after Vercel redeploy/hard refresh.
- **Follow-up:** Verify login works after redeploy. If storage/resume operations fail, migrate backend VM `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from legacy JWT `service_role` to a new `sb_secret_...` key and restart pm2.

### 2026-04-26 — Production-readiness audit closed (9/9 + 1 latent bug) + e2e harness shipped
- **What:** End-to-end pass through the production-readiness audit. All 9 section-N recommendations addressed:
  1. **#1–3 Cross-user backend fixes** (PR #9) — `runReclassifyUnclassified` now requires + scopes by `userId`; `/career/tracker` reads per-user `evaluations` (not the global file); `/career/tracker/raw`, `/career/reports`, `/career/reports/:filename`, and the legacy `/automations/auto-apply` return 410.
  2. **#4 JWT in URLs** (PR #10) — replaced `withAuthQuery`-wrapped report/download URLs with `fetch + blob URL`. Frontend bundle no longer contains JWT-in-URL pattern for download/report flows; SSE helpers (`findPeopleStream`, `scoreFitUrl`) intentionally retain `?access_token=` since EventSource can't send headers.
  3. **#5 Drop founder DEFAULTs** (PR #11 + manual SQL) — migration 007 dropped `DEFAULT '70df2946-…'` on the 11 per-user tables; applied to Supabase via dashboard.
  4. **#6 Playwright e2e suite** (PRs #13/#17/#18/#19, four-PR ladder) — harness, 6 happy paths, mobile viewport, auth-required regression, edge-case routing. **23/23 pass in CI** (run 24971336579, 1m1s). Nightly cron at 09:00 UTC. Two-user cross-isolation + write-path tests deferred (PR-E).
  5. **#7 Typecheck + verify-migrations scripts** (`0bb272d` on main) — `npm run typecheck` (node --check sweep + ESLint) and `npm run verify-migrations` (schema-invariant queries, optional DATABASE_URL).
  6. **#8 Privacy: demographic_consent gate** (PR #12) — `PUT /api/career/profile` now 403s on demographic writes without consent; consent withdrawal force-nulls the demographic fields. GDPR export/delete + encryption deferred until a real second user.
  7. **#9 USA-only decision** (`bc898ca` on main) — documented as intentional in README "Geographic scope"; hardcoded US filters retained as design choices.
  8. **Hygiene** — VM-side `.env.bak` and `.env.save` deleted; `.gitignore` patched (`c1793b1`) to block ad-hoc `.env.bak`/`.env.save`/`.env.swp`/`.env.orig`.
  - **Post-audit bug surfaced + fixed:** profile UPSERT was returning 500 ("ON CONFLICT specification") because migration 003's unique index is partial (`WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL`). Issue #14 + PR #15 added the predicate to the ON CONFLICT clause. Live-verified end-to-end: gate works, withdrawal erases, UPSERT returns 200.
  - **Branch unification:** PR #16 merged `phase-4-pg` (3 weeks of backend work) into `main`. Resolved `.gitignore` conflict, renamed colliding `005_storage_buckets.sql` → `008_storage_buckets.sql`, added the previously-untracked `003_per_user_isolation.sql`. Long-running PR #3 closed as superseded. `main` is now the single canonical branch.
  - **Tooling on main:** `scripts/verify-baseline.mjs` (`12f8f2a`) probes prod for audit-fix endpoints; `scripts/typecheck.mjs` + `scripts/verify-migrations.mjs` (`0bb272d`); `scripts/create-e2e-user.mjs` (PR #17) for one-time test-user provisioning via Supabase admin API.
- **Files:** see PRs #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19 + commits `12f8f2a`, `c1793b1`, `0bb272d`, `bc898ca`, `4894728` on main.
- **Status:** all PRs merged to `main` (`main` head: `48fbc1c`). VM fast-forwarded through `8ac20b6` post-#15; pm2 restart count 39, online. Migration 007 applied to Supabase. Vercel auto-deployed all main pushes. Nightly e2e workflow on GitHub Actions: green (run 24971336579, 23/23). Local + CI verification matrix: backend tests 12/12; frontend tests 7/7; e2e 23/23; typecheck clean (54 files); lint clean; e2e baseline endpoints flipped from `pre-fix` to `FIXED` per `scripts/verify-baseline.mjs`.
- **Follow-up:**
  1. **Rotate the JWT now** — multiple valid Supabase access_tokens (founder account) were pasted in chat transcripts during live verification. Sign out + back in on `outreach-jt.vercel.app` to invalidate.
  2. **Add `E2E_REFRESH_TOKEN` to GitHub repo secrets** — already done via `scripts/create-e2e-user.mjs`; `E2E_TEST_EMAIL` + `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD` should be saved locally (password manager) for manual rotation if the refresh token is ever invalidated.
  3. **PR-E (deferred e2e items):** two-user cross-isolation tests + write-path tests. Two-user setup needs a second admin-API user + `E2E_REFRESH_TOKEN_USER_B` secret. Write-path tests need either a staging Supabase project or in-test cleanup using the admin API.
  4. **GDPR export/delete + field-level encryption** — defer until a non-founder user is actually onboarded.
  5. **README "Known gaps" section is stale** — still lists "backend is unauthenticated" + "every user sees every other user's data". Both are resolved as of this session. Worth a docs-only follow-up PR.
  6. **`HANDOFF.md`** known-gaps list at the top hasn't been updated either; same staleness.

### 2026-04-26 — Production hardening fixes deployed
- **What:** Shipped the final audit fix pass: per-user DB uniqueness migrations, expanded Auto Apply profile + explicit consent gate, safer Auto Apply preview/queue filters, Ranked Roles visible error state, scraper failure/status refresh, mobile/tablet layout safeguards, and lint cleanup.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/App.jsx:1](frontend/src/App.jsx#L1), [frontend/src/api.js:1](frontend/src/api.js#L1), [frontend/src/components/AutoApplyPage.jsx:1](frontend/src/components/AutoApplyPage.jsx#L1), [frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx:1](frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx#L1), [frontend/src/components/CareerOpsPage.jsx:1](frontend/src/components/CareerOpsPage.jsx#L1), [frontend/src/components/ScraperPage.jsx:1](frontend/src/components/ScraperPage.jsx#L1), [frontend/src/index.css:1](frontend/src/index.css#L1), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js:1](../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js#L1), [../outreach-local/backend/services/autoApplier.js:1](../outreach-local/backend/services/autoApplier.js#L1), [../outreach-local/supabase/migrations/005_per_user_uniqueness.sql:1](../outreach-local/supabase/migrations/005_per_user_uniqueness.sql#L1), [../outreach-local/supabase/migrations/006_auto_apply_safety_profile.sql:1](../outreach-local/supabase/migrations/006_auto_apply_safety_profile.sql#L1)
- **Status:** committed/pushed and deployed. Frontend `main`: `6f84fda`; backend `phase-4-pg`: `5cce7a7`. Vercel routes `/apply/auto-apply` and `/apply/ranked` return HTTP 200 with the new deployment. VM fast-forwarded to `5cce7a7`, PM2 is online, public backend health is OK, and Supabase migrations 005/006 were applied. Checks passed: frontend tests 7/7, backend tests 12/12, frontend lint clean, frontend build passes with only the existing large-bundle warning, frontend/backend audits clean, backend JS syntax sweep passes.
- **Follow-up:** User should hard-refresh, save Auto Apply consent/preferences before queueing, and browser-verify `/apply/ranked`, `/apply/auto-apply`, `/discover/scraper`, `/discover/companies`, `/outreach`, and mobile layout while logged in. Apify actors may still fail if account quota/actor limits are exhausted; the app now surfaces that faster, but quota itself is external.

### 2026-04-26 — Auto-apply from Companies + Portal Scanner US-only + Resume Library cleanup
- **What:**
  - **Auto-Apply from any company (option C, both placements):** New backend endpoints `POST /api/career/auto-apply-company/:id/queue` (queue all known scraped roles) and `POST /api/career/auto-apply-company/:id/scrape-and-queue` (scrape careers page first, then queue). Both create `evaluations` rows with `apply_mode='auto'` + `apply_status='queued'`, idempotent (skip URLs already in flight, re-queue failed ones). Frontend: small `🤖 Apply` pill on every Companies list row + a full "Auto-Apply this company" panel on Company Detail with both actions and inline status.
  - **Portal Scanner US-only (Career Ops):** Career Ops Portal Scanner has its own scrape path (`scanGreenhouse/Lever/Ashby` in `routes/careerOps.js`) that didn't apply our `isUSLocation()` filter, so users kept seeing Toronto / Sydney / Bangalore. Added `isUSLocationPortal()` + `greenhouseUsLocation()` (prefers `job.offices[]` over the freeform `job.location.name`) and applied to all three scan functions.
  - **Resume Library cleanup:** Auto-Apply Setup tab was showing TWO Resume Library cards (per-user storage + legacy folder fallback). Dropped the legacy card entirely along with its `resumes`/`resumeDir` state, the `api.career.resumesLibrary()` fetch, the re-scan after Save Profile, and the now-useless "Resume folder (local path)" profile field. Auto-Apply Setup now shows one Resume Library section.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/api.js:248](frontend/src/api.js#L248), [frontend/src/components/CategoryView.jsx:394](frontend/src/components/CategoryView.jsx#L394), [frontend/src/components/CompanyDetail.jsx:521](frontend/src/components/CompanyDetail.jsx#L521), [frontend/src/components/CompanyDetail.jsx:649](frontend/src/components/CompanyDetail.jsx#L649), [frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx:436](frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx#L436), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js:299](../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js#L299), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js:696](../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js#L696)
- **Status:** committed/pushed. Frontend `main`: `06aac98` (resume library cleanup) + `4857bd9` (auto-apply UI). Backend `phase-4-pg`: `8ad6716` (US-only Portal Scanner) + `d0dfa5b` (auto-apply endpoints). Frontend build passes. **VM deploy pending** to ship `d0dfa5b` (run `ssh -t ubuntu@140.245.15.56 'sudo bash /home/ubuntu/outreach/deploy/update.sh'`). Backend audit + tests still 12/12.
- **Apify status:** `/api/health` shows `has_apify: true` which only proves the token is configured, not the credit balance. To check actual quota: open https://console.apify.com → top-right shows monthly credit balance ($5/mo on FREE) + actor-specific usage. Symptom of exhaustion is actors returning SUCCEEDED with 0 items or `Monthly usage hard limit exceeded` errors. Career Ops Portal Scanner does **not** depend on Apify (uses direct Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby APIs) so it stays alive even when Apify is broken — only the general Job Scraper at `/discover/scraper` needs Apify for LinkedIn/Wellfound/Indeed/Google Jobs.
- **Follow-up:** (1) **Deploy `d0dfa5b` to VM**. (2) Browser-verify: Companies list → click `🤖 Apply` on a company that has scraped roles → expect "Queued N role(s)" alert. Company Detail → click both Auto-Apply buttons. Portal Scanner → confirm Toronto/Sydney rows are gone. (3) Check Apify console for actual credit balance.

### 2026-04-25 — User asks #2/#5/#6/#7 shipped (full second-user enablement pass)
- **What:**
  - **#2 (Evaluate-tab resume picker, option A):** Backend gained `POST /api/career/parse-resume` (multer, parses PDF text without writing anything to DB) and `POST /api/career/evaluate` now accepts an optional `resumeText` in the body that overrides the saved default. Falls back to saved when body is empty (backward compat). Frontend Evaluate tab has a 3-pill picker (Use saved / Upload PDF / Paste text) with **no preselection** — Evaluate button is disabled until the user explicitly picks a mode and provides content. Upload runs through the new parse endpoint so the user's saved default is never overwritten.
  - **#5 (auto-apply pre-flight + form-completeness, option B + the extra ask):** Pulled `validateProfileForApply()` into a dependency-free module `services/applyValidation.js`. Adds checks for email format, phone format, and visa-sponsorship mismatch (when the JD explicitly denies sponsorship). On every apply, **after fill but before submit**, `detectUnfilledRequired()` walks the form for required-but-empty inputs/selects/textareas/radio groups/checkbox groups; if any exist, the worker flags `needs_review` with the field labels found and never clicks Submit. This addresses "few applications ask more information" — the worker now refuses to submit when custom required questions weren't auto-filled. Refactored Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby fillers to fill-only; submit selectors live in `SUBMIT_SELECTORS` so the main flow can scan in between. 7 new unit tests in `auto-apply-validation.test.mjs`.
  - **#6 (Handshake scraper, option A):** New `scrapeHandshake()` reads `HANDSHAKE_SESSION_COOKIE` from env, drives a Playwright browser with the cookie injected on the configurable `HANDSHAKE_BASE_URL` (default `app.joinhandshake.com`, user is on `https://uic.joinhandshake.com`), scrapes job cards from the search page, and applies the existing `INTERN_RE` + `isUSLocation` filters. Bounces with a clear log if redirected to `/login` (cookie expired). Registered in SOURCES; frontend ScraperPage shows it with an HS badge. **Action required from user:** paste cookie into VM `.env` as `HANDSHAKE_SESSION_COOKIE` + `HANDSHAKE_BASE_URL=https://uic.joinhandshake.com`, then `pm2 restart outreach-backend`.
  - **#7 (resume library → Supabase Storage, option B):** New `services/resumeStorage.js` wraps Supabase Storage REST API with the service-role key — no new npm dep. Three buckets (`resume-library`, `resumes`, `tailored-pdfs`), all per-user paths `<user_id>/...`. New endpoints `GET/POST/DELETE /api/career/library`. Migration `005_storage_buckets.sql` creates buckets + per-user RLS policies (`storage.foldername(name)[1] = auth.uid()::text`). Frontend Auto-Apply Setup gains a "Resume Library — per-user (cloud storage)" card above the legacy folder card with per-archetype upload buttons (aiml/ds/swe/devops/fullstack/startup/misc), file list, delete. Legacy `scanResumes()` filesystem path stays in place for backward compat — Phase 2 will switch the auto-apply worker to read from storage. Migration script `scripts/migrate-resumes-to-storage.mjs` uploads existing PDFs idempotently.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/api.js:213](frontend/src/api.js#L213), [frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx:1100](frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx#L1100), [frontend/src/components/ScraperPage.jsx:5](frontend/src/components/ScraperPage.jsx#L5), [supabase/migrations/005_storage_buckets.sql:1](supabase/migrations/005_storage_buckets.sql#L1), [../outreach-local/backend/services/applyValidation.js:1](../outreach-local/backend/services/applyValidation.js#L1), [../outreach-local/backend/services/resumeStorage.js:1](../outreach-local/backend/services/resumeStorage.js#L1), [../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js:725](../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js#L725), [../outreach-local/backend/services/autoApplier.js:107](../outreach-local/backend/services/autoApplier.js#L107), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js:93](../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js#L93), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js:259](../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js#L259), [../outreach-local/backend/tests/auto-apply-validation.test.mjs:1](../outreach-local/backend/tests/auto-apply-validation.test.mjs#L1), [../outreach-local/scripts/migrate-resumes-to-storage.mjs:1](../outreach-local/scripts/migrate-resumes-to-storage.mjs#L1)
- **Status:** committed/pushed. Frontend `main`: `f87cf27`. Backend `phase-4-pg`: `d096d3e`. Frontend tests 7/7, backend tests 12/12 (5 templates + 7 apply validation), frontend build passes, backend audit clean. **VM deploy still pending** + **Supabase migration 005 pending** (creates buckets + RLS).
- **Follow-up:** **User actions required** (in order):
  1. **Apply migration 005 in Supabase SQL Editor** — paste `supabase/migrations/005_storage_buckets.sql`. Creates 3 buckets + RLS policies. Idempotent.
  2. **VM deploy:** `ssh -t ubuntu@140.245.15.56 'sudo bash /home/ubuntu/outreach/deploy/update.sh'` ships `d096d3e`.
  3. **Add Handshake env vars to VM `.env`:** `HANDSHAKE_SESSION_COOKIE=<paste from DevTools>` + `HANDSHAKE_BASE_URL=https://uic.joinhandshake.com`, then `pm2 restart outreach-backend`.
  4. **One-time migration of existing 6 PDFs to storage:** `set -a; source /home/ubuntu/outreach/.env; set +a; USER_ID=70df2946-a46e-4b63-832c-2822cda4cf4b LOCAL_DIR=/home/ubuntu/outreach/resumes node /home/ubuntu/outreach/scripts/migrate-resumes-to-storage.mjs`. Idempotent.
  5. **Browser-verify:** (a) `/discover/evaluate` Evaluate tab — pick each of the three pills, evaluate something. (b) Auto-Apply Setup → upload a PDF to a per-user archetype slot, confirm it lists. (c) Job Scraper → click Handshake (after cookie set). (d) Queue an evaluation with profile email broken — auto-apply should flag needs_review with the bad-email reason.
  6. **Phase 2 (later):** flip `services/resumeRegistry.scanResumes()` to read from Supabase Storage instead of filesystem; route `POST /api/career/resume` to storage; thread storage download into autoApplier so Playwright reads from a temp file pulled out of the cloud bucket. Then delete on-disk PDFs.
  7. **You accidentally pasted into `.env.example`** during Handshake cookie collection — remove the `HANDSHAKE_SESSION_COOKIE =1.1.57293952.1770171320` line from `email tracker/.env.example` (it's tracked).

### 2026-04-25 — User asks #1/#3/#8 + production-readiness audit
- **What:**
  - **#1 Career Ops UX:** reordered tabs so 🔍 Portal Scanner is the default landing tab (was Evaluate). Added a **+ Auto-Apply** button on every History row (`EvalCard`); the button is disabled and shows ✓ Queued once the row's `apply_mode='auto'` and `apply_status='queued'`. Backend `GET /career/evaluations` now returns `apply_mode + apply_status` so the initial state is correct.
  - **#3 USA-only scrape filter:** added `isUSLocation()` helper in `services/scraper.js` with a comprehensive non-US country/city blocklist (Toronto/London/Bangalore/Dublin/Berlin/Paris/Sydney/etc.). Applied to LinkedIn/Wellfound/Indeed/Dice/GoogleJobs/AIJobs/RemoteAI/Hiring.cafe/Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby paths. 16/16 unit cases pass; "Remote"/"USA"/empty kept by design.
  - **#8 Multi-template support:** `normalizeOutreachTemplates()` now accepts `variants: [{ id, kind: email|linkedin, name, body }]` capped at 20, IDs auto-generated. `templateGuidance()` in `services/ai.js` appends matching variants as additional style examples so saved variants actually shape generated outreach. `TemplatesPage.jsx` gains "+ Add email variant" / "+ Add LinkedIn variant" with edit/delete + per-variant char counter. Outreach CRM header now has a ✏ Manage templates button. 5/5 backend template tests + 7/7 frontend tests pass.
  - **Audit fixes shipped:** (a) Tailor PDF was passing hardcoded `'Sravya Rachakonda'` as the candidate name even though the route loaded one from meta — fixed to pull from `user_profile.first_name + last_name` first, filename second, generic third. Same fix in `autoApplier.js`. (b) `resumeGenerator.generateResumePDF` used `waitUntil: 'networkidle0'` which can hang on stalled subresource requests; switched to `'load'` + explicit timeouts on launch / setContent / pdf so PDF failures surface fast instead of timing out. The VM had `_tmp-*.html` files written but no matching PDFs, confirming Puppeteer was the failure point.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx:798](frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx#L798), [frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx:1088](frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx#L1088), [frontend/src/components/TemplatesPage.jsx:1](frontend/src/components/TemplatesPage.jsx#L1), [frontend/src/components/OutreachPage.jsx:75](frontend/src/components/OutreachPage.jsx#L75), [../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js:51](../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js#L51), [../outreach-local/backend/services/outreachTemplates.js:14](../outreach-local/backend/services/outreachTemplates.js#L14), [../outreach-local/backend/services/ai.js:245](../outreach-local/backend/services/ai.js#L245), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js:158](../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js#L158), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js:546](../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js#L546), [../outreach-local/backend/services/resumeGenerator.js:255](../outreach-local/backend/services/resumeGenerator.js#L255), [../outreach-local/backend/services/autoApplier.js:233](../outreach-local/backend/services/autoApplier.js#L233), [../outreach-local/backend/tests/ai-templates.test.mjs:1](../outreach-local/backend/tests/ai-templates.test.mjs#L1)
- **Status:** committed/pushed. Frontend `main`: `9e61e4e`. Backend `phase-4-pg`: `d49c6f2` + `b2d7c92` (tailor-pdf fix). Backend tests 5/5, frontend tests 7/7, frontend build passes (705KB bundle, 184KB gzipped), frontend audit clean, backend audit clean, lint exits 0 with 4 pre-existing exhaustive-deps warnings. **VM deploy still pending** — sandbox blocks per-deploy without explicit auth.
- **Follow-up:** User runs `ssh -t ubuntu@140.245.15.56 'sudo bash /home/ubuntu/outreach/deploy/update.sh'` to ship `b2d7c92`. After deploy: (a) retry Tailor PDF on an evaluation — expect a real `cv-*.pdf` to appear, no 500. (b) Browser-verify Career Ops tabs default to Portal Scanner, and History rows show the ✓ Queued state correctly. (c) Add an extra template variant on `/outreach/templates`, generate copy, confirm AI uses it. (d) Re-run a US-only scrape and check that no Toronto/London/Bangalore rows appear. **Open user-asks still requiring answers:** #2 (Evaluate-tab resume picker A/B/C), #5 (auto-apply conservative-mode A/B/C), #6 (Handshake auth A/B/C), #7 (resume library per-user A/B). The audit report below documents what already exists in each area.

### 2026-04-25 — Diagnosed + fixed LinkedIn scrape returning 0
- **What:** User clicked LinkedIn → "no companies found" even though LinkedIn had hundreds of roles. VM logs showed `valig/linkedin-jobs-scraper → 100 items` but `[linkedin] returned 0 results`. Inspected the actor's dataset directly (`mCyre4ZwR4MkGjz0F`) — actor returned 100 unrelated full-time roles ("Director, Customer Success", "HR Assistant", …); `valig` ignored the `intern 2026` keyword. The post-fetch `INTERN_RE` filter correctly dropped them all, but the for-loop then `return [] `'d instead of falling through to the next actor (`curious_coder`, which uses LinkedIn's own search URL and would honor the keyword) or to the Greenhouse fallback. Same trap in indeed + google_jobs handlers. Fixed: when `items.length > 0 && results.length === 0`, log sample title and `continue` to next attempt.
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js:495](../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js#L495), [../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js:594](../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js#L594), [../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js:697](../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js#L697)
- **Status:** committed + pushed on `phase-4-pg`: `675c4cc`. `node --check` passes. **VM deploy blocked by sandbox (auth needed per deploy).**
- **Follow-up:** User runs `ssh -t ubuntu@140.245.15.56 'sudo bash /home/ubuntu/outreach/deploy/update.sh'`, then retries the LinkedIn scrape from `/discover/scraper`. Expected: either `curious_coder` returns intern roles via LinkedIn's keyword-honoring search URL, or all actors fall through to the Greenhouse direct-fetch fallback (which already works — earlier logs showed it returning 19 results). If `curious_coder` also produces non-intern items, we have a deeper "actors don't honor keyword on LinkedIn" problem and should consider switching to LinkedIn's public job-search RSS feed.

### 2026-04-25 — VM backend deploy of stabilization pass
- **What:** User ran `sudo bash /home/ubuntu/outreach/deploy/update.sh` over SSH on the Oracle VM. Fast-forwarded `phase-4-pg` from the previously deployed tip up to `43d9124` (templates + audit stabilization). pm2 restarted, deploy script's health-check loop reported healthy on attempt 2, and public `https://outreach-jt.duckdns.org/api/health` returns `{"status":"ok","auth_mode":"enforce"}`.
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/deploy/update.sh:1](../outreach-local/deploy/update.sh#L1)
- **Status:** live on VM at commit `43d9124`. The Templates feature backend (`/api/generate/templates`, `meta.outreach_templates`, AI prompt style anchors) and the Company Detail `meta` upsert conflict-target fix are now active in prod.
- **Follow-up:** Browser-verify as `lakshmisravyar@gmail.com`: (a) save email + LinkedIn templates on `/outreach/templates`, then generate copy and confirm saved style is used; (b) Company Detail score-fit + per-company resume upload/delete; (c) `/apply/ranked` (ErrorBoundary will now surface stack if it crashes); (d) Outreach CRM shows 36 contacts.

### 2026-04-25 — Production-readiness audit pass + narrow fixes
- **What:** Ran repository/feature audit checks across frontend and deployed backend worktree. Fixed root `npm test` script, Vite ESM lint issue, Company Detail authenticated fetch bypasses for score-fit + per-company resume upload/delete, mounted the existing ErrorBoundary to avoid blank page crashes, and fixed backend `meta` upsert conflict target for company resume PDF parsing.
- **Files:** [package.json:16](package.json#L16), [frontend/vite.config.js:5](frontend/vite.config.js#L5), [frontend/src/components/CompanyDetail.jsx:1144](frontend/src/components/CompanyDetail.jsx#L1144), [frontend/src/main.jsx:5](frontend/src/main.jsx#L5), [tests/api-client.test.mjs:67](tests/api-client.test.mjs#L67), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/companies.js:59](../outreach-local/backend/routes/companies.js#L59)
- **Status:** committed/pushed with the stabilization commits: frontend `main` `329715c`, backend `phase-4-pg` `43d9124`; tests/build/audits now pass as recorded below. Backend deploy to Oracle VM was attempted but blocked by the tool approval layer, so VM is still on pre-`43d9124` until user runs deploy manually.
- **Follow-up:** Run `sudo bash /home/ubuntu/outreach/deploy/update.sh` on the VM to ship backend changes, then browser-verify `/apply/ranked`, Company Detail Career Ops score-fit/resume upload/delete, and scraper/status flows. Plan follow-up migration for per-user UNIQUE constraints before relying on clean second-user imports.

### 2026-04-25 — Stabilization pass: templates, login tabs, audits
- **What:** Completed the Templates feature end-to-end and turned the login form into Sign in / Sign up tabs. `/outreach/templates` now loads/saves per-user email + LinkedIn templates via `/api/generate/templates`, stores them in `meta`, and generation routes pass saved templates into the AI prompt as style anchors. Added frontend API tests and backend template normalization tests. Generated/tracked backend and frontend lockfiles so audits are reproducible.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/components/TemplatesPage.jsx:1](frontend/src/components/TemplatesPage.jsx#L1), [frontend/src/components/Login.jsx:41](frontend/src/components/Login.jsx#L41), [frontend/src/api.js:134](frontend/src/api.js#L134), [tests/api-client.test.mjs:77](tests/api-client.test.mjs#L77), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/generate.js:18](../outreach-local/backend/routes/generate.js#L18), [../outreach-local/backend/services/outreachTemplates.js:1](../outreach-local/backend/services/outreachTemplates.js#L1), [../outreach-local/backend/tests/ai-templates.test.mjs:1](../outreach-local/backend/tests/ai-templates.test.mjs#L1)
- **Status:** committed/pushed. Frontend `main`: `329715c`. Backend `phase-4-pg`: `43d9124`. `npm test` passes 7/7, `npm test --prefix backend` passes 2/2, frontend build passes, frontend lint exits 0 with 4 warnings, frontend audit passes, backend audit passes, backend changed files pass `node --check`. Local Vite preview served `/apply/ranked`, `/outreach/templates`, `/discover/scraper`, and `/discover/companies` with HTTP 200. Backend deploy to VM was blocked by tool approval, not by code.
- **Follow-up:** Backend deploy still required: `sudo bash /home/ubuntu/outreach/deploy/update.sh` on the VM. Browser-verify saving templates as a logged-in user and generating email/LinkedIn copy uses the saved style after Vercel deploy + VM deploy.

### 2026-04-25 — Companies counts render from cache
- **What:** Removed the visible loading/dash pass on `/discover/companies` by caching stats + category counts per user in `sessionStorage`, seeding from the parent App stats snapshot, and refreshing counts in the background.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/components/CompanyDashboard.jsx:44](frontend/src/components/CompanyDashboard.jsx#L44), [frontend/src/components/CompanyDashboard.jsx:69](frontend/src/components/CompanyDashboard.jsx#L69), [frontend/src/App.jsx:341](frontend/src/App.jsx#L341)
- **Status:** committed on `main`: `0b59c6d`; `npm run build --prefix frontend` passed; not browser-verified after Vercel deploy.
- **Follow-up:** After Vercel deploy, visit `/discover/companies` once to seed the cache, then navigate away/back or refresh in the same tab and confirm the page does not show the intermediate loading/dash state.

### 2026-04-25 — Companies flicker + Job Scraper source fix
- **What:** Prevented the Companies page from briefly rendering real-looking zero counts by tracking stats/category loaded flags. Routed Job Scraper per-source buttons through canonical `/jobs/scrape` so results land in the main `jobs` table, added selected-source backend support, added a LinkedIn direct Greenhouse fallback when Apify actors fail, and kept legacy `/companies/scrape/:src` from dropping `name`-shaped results.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/components/CompanyDashboard.jsx:48](frontend/src/components/CompanyDashboard.jsx#L48), [frontend/src/components/ScraperPage.jsx:43](frontend/src/components/ScraperPage.jsx#L43), [frontend/src/api.js:106](frontend/src/api.js#L106), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/jobs.js:19](../outreach-local/backend/routes/jobs.js#L19), [../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js:519](../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js#L519), [../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js:1172](../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js#L1172), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/companies.js:293](../outreach-local/backend/routes/companies.js#L293)
- **Status:** frontend committed/pushed on `main`: `4584276`; backend committed/pushed/deployed on `phase-4-pg`: `d0016ee`; `npm run build --prefix frontend` passed; `node --check` passed for changed backend files; VM deploy completed and public health returned `ok`.
- **Follow-up:** Wait for Vercel deploy, hard-refresh `/discover/companies` and `/discover/scraper`, then retry LinkedIn/GitHub/Google source buttons while logged in.

### 2026-04-25 — Dashboard surfaces auto-apply queue counts
- **What:** Compact card above the "Last scrape" widget on the Dashboard now shows queue counts (Needs Review / Queued / Submitted / Failed / Unsupported). Border + label flip red when `needs_review > 0` so profile-incomplete items are visible without navigating into Career Ops. Hidden entirely when nothing is in flight. Click → `/career-ops`.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/components/DashboardPage.jsx:48](frontend/src/components/DashboardPage.jsx#L48)
- **Status:** committed and pushed `main`: `8d87bf2`. Build passes. No backend changes — reads from the existing `/api/career/auto-apply-queue` endpoint.

### 2026-04-25 — Nightly auto-apply pipeline + visible queue (DEPLOYED)
- **What:** End-to-end nightly automation. Cron at 07:00 UTC iterates over every user with `nightly_pipeline_settings.enabled=true` and runs the orchestrator: scan Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby (per `roleType`) → skip URLs already evaluated → evaluate new ones via OpenAI → if `score >= minScore` → set apply_mode=auto + apply_status=queued → run Playwright worker against up to `maxApps` queued items. Worker uses **library resume** (no per-role tailoring) when `useLibraryResume=true` so the pipeline runs fast and unattended. Profile-incomplete items now flag `needs_review` instead of `failed` so the user can fix and retry.
- **New endpoints:** GET `/api/career/auto-apply-queue` (queue + counts), GET/PUT `/api/career/nightly-settings`, POST `/api/career/nightly-pipeline`, GET `/api/career/nightly-pipeline/last-run`. Orchestrator extracted to [services/nightlyPipeline.js](../outreach-local/backend/services/nightlyPipeline.js) so route + cron share code. `scanGreenhouse/Lever/Ashby` were promoted from file-local to exported in `routes/careerOps.js`.
- **autoApplier extensions:** new `STATUS.needs_review`; `useLibraryResume` flag on `processOneEvaluation` skips tailored PDF gen and picks straight from the resume library by archetype; `runQueueOnce` accepts both positional `userId` and `{userId}` object forms (backward-compat); summary now includes `needsReview` count.
- **Settings (per-user):** enabled (default off), roleType (intern/fulltime/all, default intern), minScore (0–100, default 85), maxApps (1–200, default 50), useLibraryResume (default true). Stored in `meta.nightly_pipeline_settings`.
- **UI:** Auto-Apply Setup tab now leads with two new cards. (1) "Queue & Status" — every flagged role grouped by status (Needs Review / Queued / Submitted / Failed / Unsupported), each item shows company, role, grade, score, source (Manual eval / Bulk eval / 🌙 Nightly / Portal Scanner), platform, and date; needs_review items show their error inline. (2) "🌙 Nightly Pipeline" — enable toggle, role-type selector, min-score / max-apps inputs, Save Settings, and "Run Pipeline Now" button for immediate manual trigger; shows last run summary inline.
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js:626](../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js#L626), [../outreach-local/backend/services/autoApplier.js:30](../outreach-local/backend/services/autoApplier.js#L30), [../outreach-local/backend/services/nightlyPipeline.js:1](../outreach-local/backend/services/nightlyPipeline.js#L1), [../outreach-local/backend/server.js:434](../outreach-local/backend/server.js#L434), [frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx:435](frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx#L435)
- **Status:** committed `phase-4-pg`: `2890bf0`; `main`: `3682c1b`. Deployed to VM (healthy attempt 2). Build passes.
- **Follow-up:** **User must enable** the toggle from Auto-Apply Setup before the cron will fire — defaults to off for safety. After enabling, first cron run is at 07:00 UTC (≈2am Central). Manual "Run Pipeline Now" works immediately. Monitor `pm2 logs` for `[nightly-cron]` and `[nightly]` lines to confirm scheduled execution.

### 2026-04-25 — Portal Scanner role-type filter + persistence + bulk evaluate + Add-to-Queue button
- **What:** Career Ops UX bundle responding to four user asks at once.
  1. **Portal Scanner role-type filter** — segmented control (🎓 Internship / 💼 Full-Time / 📋 All) drives the existing backend `roleType` param. Backend already supported `intern|fulltime|all`; frontend just exposed it. Changing the toggle auto-rescans.
  2. **Portal Scanner persistence** — sessionStorage cache keyed `careerOps:portalScan:v2` (1h TTL) preserves jobs/bySource/roleType across tab switches. Header shows "last scanned 5m ago" and the button label flips to "↻ Re-scan" when cached results exist.
  3. **Bulk evaluate scanned roles** — "Evaluate N roles" button on the Portal Scanner triggers `api.career.batchEvaluate` against the visible filtered list (capped at 10 per backend limit). Inline progress banner reports outcome and points the user to History.
  4. **"Add to Auto-Apply Queue" button on EvaluationReport** — queue-without-running path. Sets `apply_mode='auto'` + `apply_status='queued'` via existing PATCH endpoints. Hidden once queued/submitted. Resume archetype matching still happens at run-time inside the worker (`pickResumeForRole` in `services/resumeRegistry.js`) — picks from the user's 6 archetype PDFs based on the role archetype detected by the evaluator.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/api.js:227](frontend/src/api.js#L227), [frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx:628](frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx#L628), [frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx:123](frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx#L123)
- **Status:** committed and pushed on `main`: `a415306` + `b6e2030`. Build passes. **No backend changes** — all reuses existing endpoints, so no VM deploy needed; Vercel auto-deploys.
- **Follow-up:** After Vercel deploys, verify (a) Portal Scanner filter works, (b) cache persists across History/Evaluate tab navigation, (c) bulk evaluate routes to History, (d) "Add to Auto-Apply Queue" button shows up when status is not_started.

### 2026-04-25 — Broader role queries + per-source breakdown + new-company names (DEPLOYED)
- **What:** Three things the user asked for in one pass.
  1. **Broadened ALL scraper default queries** so internships outside CS get returned. `getSearchTerms` defaults to `['intern 2026', 'internship 2026', 'new grad 2026']` instead of `'software engineer intern 2026'`. Subcategory + category branches drop the SWE prefix too — e.g. picking "Marketing & Creative" now searches `Marketing intern 2026`, not `Marketing software engineer intern`. scraper.js linkedin/wellfound/indeed/dice/google_jobs and apify.js linkedin/google_jobs/wellfound/yc-Serper-fallback all role-agnostic now. SEARCH_TERMS_MAP role-specific entries (Quant, IB, etc.) intentionally untouched.
  2. **Persist newCompanyNames (top 25) + errors** into `meta.last_scrape_summary` alongside the count fields.
  3. **Dashboard "Last scrape" card now answers two questions** at a glance: (a) per-source pills `linkedin: 100, wellfound: 12, github: 50` with red pills for failed sources (so user sees which scrapers actually work), (b) first 8 newly-added company names as clickable links to `/companies?search=<name>` with `+N more` for the rest.
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js:114](../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js#L114), [../outreach-local/backend/services/apify.js:212](../outreach-local/backend/services/apify.js#L212), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/jobs.js:144](../outreach-local/backend/routes/jobs.js#L144), [frontend/src/components/DashboardPage.jsx:117](frontend/src/components/DashboardPage.jsx#L117)
- **Status:** committed `phase-4-pg`: `60615c5`; `main`: `5503dab`. Deployed to VM (healthy attempt 2). Build passes.
- **Follow-up:** User runs an all-sources scrape; Dashboard card will show per-source breakdown so any silently-broken scraper is visible. Names of new companies surfaced inline. If LinkedIn now returns 1000 results because the broader query catches all intern types (could be too noisy), revisit — may want to add a role-type selector in the Job Scraper UI.

### 2026-04-25 — Honest scrape feedback + Last-scrape Dashboard widget (DEPLOYED)
- **What:** "+0 companies added" was misleading — scrapers actually return 100 results that all dedupe against the user's existing 1,499-company DB. Now backend `/api/jobs/scrape` returns `found` (total returned by all scrapers this run) + `alreadyInDb` (found - added) and persists the summary into `meta.last_scrape_summary`. Frontend ScraperPage reads normalized fields and shows: `found 100 (+5 new, 95 already in DB)` / `found 100 — all already in DB` / `+5 companies added` / `no companies found` instead of always `+0`. Dashboard gained a "Last scrape" card under the stats row showing age + found/added/inDb counts, fed by `stats.lastScrape` from `/api/stats`.
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/backend/routes/jobs.js:133](../outreach-local/backend/routes/jobs.js#L133), [../outreach-local/backend/server.js:160](../outreach-local/backend/server.js#L160), [frontend/src/components/ScraperPage.jsx:39](frontend/src/components/ScraperPage.jsx#L39), [frontend/src/components/DashboardPage.jsx:117](frontend/src/components/DashboardPage.jsx#L117)
- **Status:** committed `phase-4-pg`: `ee4b6e2`; `main`: `e214c80`. Deployed to VM (healthy attempt 2). Build passes.
- **Follow-up:** After Vercel auto-deploys frontend, run a scrape — Activity Log will read honestly and the Dashboard will get a "Last scrape · just now · Found 100 · 100 already in DB" card.

### 2026-04-25 — LinkedIn scraper actor schema realigned + burn detection extended (DEPLOYED)
- **What:** After the user's Apify key swap (`marbled_geothermal` → `charitable_raisin`), the burn errors stopped but every LinkedIn scrape still returned 0 — Apify changed two things on their side: (1) `bebity/linkedin-jobs-scraper` flipped from free-trial to paid-only, (2) `curious_coder/linkedin-jobs-scraper` changed input schema to require `urls: [...]` instead of `keyword`. The Job Scraper page calls `services/scraper.js` (separate from `services/apify.js`), and only `apify.js` had been updated to the new schemas. Patched `scraper.js`: primary actor → `valig` (free, keyword schema, was working pre-burn), fallback → `curious_coder` with new `urls` schema, dropped `bebity`. Also wired `noteApifyError` into all 4 actor catches in `scraper.js` (linkedin/wellfound/indeed/google_jobs) plus the central `runApifyActor` wrapper, so the sidebar burn indicator now covers BOTH scraper paths. Required adding `export` to `noteApifyError` in `apify.js` (forgot in `5660817`; first deploy crashed with `does not provide an export`).
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js:1](../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js#L1), [../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js:469](../outreach-local/backend/services/scraper.js#L469), [../outreach-local/backend/services/apify.js:30](../outreach-local/backend/services/apify.js#L30)
- **Status:** committed `phase-4-pg`: `d8bf3b4` + `fa28694`; live on VM (deploy script polled health check successfully on attempt 2 — proving the deploy-script polling fix from `c8c6d06` works in practice). Backend stable, pm2 PID 42411.
- **Follow-up:** User should retry LinkedIn scrape from the Job Scraper page. If valig works on the new account, expect new companies. If it still 0s, the new account may already be quota-limited (Apify FREE tier's $5 monthly cap is small) — the sidebar Apify dot will go red within seconds and we know the burn detection now covers `scraper.js` too.

### 2026-04-25 — VM Apify token swap (user-side)
- **What:** User pasted the new `apify_api_kzd...` token (`charitable_raisin` account) and the VM .env was updated (likely user-side; my SSH sed was sandbox-blocked but the VM logs subsequently showed the new account responding). Old `marbled_geothermal` quota-burn errors stopped appearing.
- **Status:** verified live — pm2 on `5660817` then later `fa28694`, Apify auth no longer 403s.
- **Follow-up:** New account is also FREE plan; will burn through actor credits eventually. Burn-detection sentinel will now flip the sidebar dot red the moment that happens (covers both apify.js and scraper.js paths).

### 2026-04-25 — Apify quota-burn surfaces in /credits/status (DEPLOYED)
- **What:** Apify's `/v2/users/me` reports the *account's* platform credit balance (reliably 0/0 on FREE accounts) — it doesn't expose the actor-side monthly limits that actually trip with `Monthly usage hard limit exceeded`. So `checkApify()` couldn't detect a burn and the sidebar Apify dot stayed green while every scrape failed silently. Fixed: module-level `apifyQuotaBurn` sentinel in `services/apify.js` is bumped by `noteApifyError(actor, err)` whenever an actor catch fires with a quota-shaped error (regex matches `hard limit|monthly usage|quota|exhausted|insufficient.*credit|402|payment required`). `creditChecker.checkAllCredits()` overlays this on top of the cached result every read — recent burns (<6h) flip `apify.critical = true` regardless of the 30-min result cache. Wired into all actor catch paths (linkedin, wellfound, people/linkedin, profile-scrape) plus `runActor()` itself as defense in depth.
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/backend/services/apify.js:13](../outreach-local/backend/services/apify.js#L13), [../outreach-local/backend/services/creditChecker.js:7](../outreach-local/backend/services/creditChecker.js#L7)
- **Status:** committed `phase-4-pg`: `5660817`; live on VM (verified `noteApifyError` × 7 in deployed apify.js, pm2 stable, `/api/health` ok).
- **Follow-up:** Sidebar Apify dot will turn red within seconds of the next quota-failed scrape. Stays red 6h post-burn (or until pm2 restart). No manual monitoring needed.

### 2026-04-25 — Sidebar rename + Apify scrape diagnosis
- **What:** User asked to rename sidebar "Evaluate a Role" to "Career Ops" since `/discover/evaluate` already houses the full Career Ops tab UI (Evaluate / Portal Scanner / Batch / History / Auto-Apply Setup). Single label change, route untouched.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/App.jsx:258](frontend/src/App.jsx#L258)
- **Status:** committed and pushed on `main`: `3e570ef`. Build passes.
- **Apify finding (open issue):** User reported "no jobs are getting scraped". Backend stderr shows `Monthly usage hard limit exceeded` on every Apify actor — LinkedIn (valig, bebity, curious_coder) AND Wellfound (curious_coder, clearpath, apify/rag-web-browser). New Apify token rotated to fresh `marbled_geothermal` FREE account validates against Apify API but `monthlyUsageLimitUsd` reports 0 — free tier credits insufficient for these actors. Greenhouse fallback IS working (returned 92 roles per logs at 03:11/03:13), so portal-scan paths still surface jobs. Real fix: upgrade Apify to a paid plan, switch to cheaper actors, or accept Greenhouse-only coverage. Not a code bug.
- **Follow-up:** Decision needed on Apify spend vs scrape coverage — if you want LinkedIn + Wellfound back, we need a paid plan or different actors.

### 2026-04-25 — Deploy script health-check race fixed
- **What:** User ran `update.sh` and got "Backend not healthy — connection refused" on localhost:3001 after pm2 restart. Backend was actually live (`/api/health` returned ok within seconds; pm2 process stable), so it was a script race: pm2 restart returns before Node binds the port. Replaced the one-shot `curl` with a 15-attempt × 2s poll (30s budget).
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/deploy/update.sh:59-71](../outreach-local/deploy/update.sh#L59-L71)
- **Status:** committed and pushed on `phase-4-pg`: `c8c6d06`. `bash -n deploy/update.sh` passed.
- **Follow-up:** The fix only applies to the deploy **after** the next one (since `update.sh` git-pulls into itself mid-run and the active shell already loaded the old script). The next run may still print the race error; the run after that will be clean.

### 2026-04-25 — VM redeploy with security fix
- **What:** User authorized + ran `update.sh` on VM. Fast-forwarded `phase-4-pg` from `86eaeed` → `54ddf62`, pm2 restarted. Script's localhost health check raced the boot (false alarm), but public `/api/health` returned ok and pm2 was stable at 34s.
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js:823](../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js#L823), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js:837](../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js#L837), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/jobs.js:1409](../outreach-local/backend/routes/jobs.js#L1409)
- **Status:** live on VM at commit `54ddf62`. The 3 JOIN scoping defenses are now in prod.
- **Follow-up:** Browser-verify `/apply/ranked` and Job Dashboard "Recent Evaluations" links still work as `lakshmisravyar`.

### 2026-04-25 — Full-app audit + 4 fixes
- **What:** End-to-end audit of repo state, builds, JWT coverage, per-user isolation, frontend↔backend contract, secret hygiene, and live VM. Fixed 4 issues uncovered.
  1. **JWT bypass** in [JobDashboard.jsx:192](frontend/src/components/JobDashboard.jsx#L192) — Recent Evaluations links rendered raw `<a href="/api/career/evaluations/X/report.html">` which 401s in enforce mode. Swapped to `api.career.reportHtmlUrl(e.id)` (same `withAuthQuery` helper used by CareerOps/Pipeline/CompanyDetail).
  2. **Per-user isolation** (defense-in-depth) — 3 queries JOIN'd `jobs` without `AND j.user_id = $X`. The driving table's user_id was scoped, so leakage required cross-user FK rows that shouldn't exist, but DB-level defense-in-depth was missing. Fixed in:
     - `GET /api/career/stats` — top-pick subquery
     - `GET /api/career/ranked` — ranked applications
     - `POST /api/jobs/contacts/:id/generate` — contact + company lookup
  3. Apify key on VM **validated** against `https://api.apify.com/v2/users/me`: length 46, prefix `apify_api_`, account `marbled_geothermal` (FREE plan). User did rotate the VM-side key (auto-generated username = fresh account). pm2 logs from earlier today still show "Monthly usage hard limit exceeded" on LinkedIn actors, but those pre-date the rotation; not yet retried post-restart.
  4. Lint debt unchanged — 47 errors are pre-existing `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`, unused vars, `vite.config.js __dirname`. Documented as architectural follow-up, not addressed.
- **Audit clean:**
  - Frontend↔backend API contract: 80+ method/path pairs, zero mismatches.
  - Secret scan: `.env` properly gitignored in both repos. No tracked credentials, only documented test-account UUID `459b9b5b...` in HANDOFF (intentional). `deploy/env.template` uses placeholders.
  - Backend syntax sweep: every `.js` under `backend/` passes `node --check`.
  - Frontend build: passes (677kb bundle, gzipped 178kb — could be code-split, low priority).
  - Live VM: `pm2` stable, `/api/health` ok, `auth_mode=enforce`.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/components/JobDashboard.jsx:192](frontend/src/components/JobDashboard.jsx#L192), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js:823](../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js#L823), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js:837](../outreach-local/backend/routes/careerOps.js#L837), [../outreach-local/backend/routes/jobs.js:1409](../outreach-local/backend/routes/jobs.js#L1409)
- **Status:** committed and pushed. Frontend on `main`: `45128da`. Backend on `phase-4-pg`: `54ddf62`. Builds + node --check pass. **Backend NOT yet redeployed** — sandbox blocked the auto-deploy for newly-committed security changes; needs explicit user authorization.
- **Follow-up:** Run `sudo bash /home/ubuntu/outreach/deploy/update.sh` on VM to ship the 3 isolation fixes. After that, browser-verify (a) Job Dashboard "Recent Evaluations" links open the report instead of 401-ing, (b) `/apply/ranked` still loads as `lakshmisravyar`. Apify scraping: if it still fails, check Apify dashboard for actor-specific monthly limits (key itself is valid).

### 2026-04-25 — VM backend deploy for sort/filter fix
- **What:** Ran `sudo bash /home/ubuntu/outreach/deploy/update.sh` on the Mumbai VM (user-authorized SSH). Fast-forwarded `phase-4-pg` from `53f0767` → `86eaeed`, pm2 restarted `outreach-backend`. The in-script localhost health check raced the boot (connection-refused at 2s uptime), but the public `https://outreach-jt.duckdns.org/api/health` returned `{"status":"ok","auth_mode":"enforce"}` four seconds later and pm2 was stable at 22s/247mb.
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/backend/routes/unified.js:50](../outreach-local/backend/routes/unified.js#L50)
- **Status:** live on VM at commit `86eaeed`. Top Companies sort + source/status filters now active in prod.
- **Follow-up:** Note the deploy script's localhost-health-check still races boot — could bump to a 5s sleep + retry loop, or trust the public health check that runs separately. Low priority. Browser-verify `/companies/[category]` sort dropdown works across all pages.

### 2026-04-25 — Quick-wins sweep (4 deferred items)
- **What:** Cleared the four deferred green-pile items in one pass.
  1. **Top Companies filter** — sort dropdown only re-ordered the loaded 50 rows and `source`/`status` filter dropdowns were silently dropped by the backend. Added `sort` (hiring|contacts|recent|az|za) + `source` + `status` query params to `/api/unified/companies`, frontend now passes them and refetches via useEffect dep on `sortBy`.
  2. **Companies page 0-flicker** — initial render showed "0 companies" + every category card at "0" before stats/categoryCounts resolved. Switched `catCounts` initial state from `{}` to `null` so the renderer can distinguish "still loading" from "loaded empty"; show "Loading…" / "—" placeholders during load.
  3. **Career Ops resume preload** — "Your Resume" section was always visible at the top of every tab including Evaluate. Now only renders on Auto-Apply Setup tab or when user has no resume yet.
  4. **Job Dashboard perf** — first paint blocked on `/dashboard/job-metrics`. Added sessionStorage SWR cache (5min TTL): instant first paint on revisit, background refresh shown by spinner in Refresh button.
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/backend/routes/unified.js:50-95](../outreach-local/backend/routes/unified.js#L50-L95), [frontend/src/api.js:151](frontend/src/api.js#L151), [frontend/src/components/CategoryView.jsx:247](frontend/src/components/CategoryView.jsx#L247), [frontend/src/components/CompanyDashboard.jsx:47](frontend/src/components/CompanyDashboard.jsx#L47), [frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx:936](frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx#L936), [frontend/src/components/JobDashboard.jsx:48](frontend/src/components/JobDashboard.jsx#L48)
- **Status:** committed and pushed. Frontend on `main`: `463f756`, `7f42c6d`, `6cf20ad`, `c2eabdb`. Backend on `phase-4-pg`: `86eaeed`. `npm run build --prefix frontend` and `node --check backend/routes/unified.js` both passed. Not browser-tested.
- **Follow-up:** **VM backend deploy required** for Top Companies filter to actually work — `sudo bash /home/ubuntu/outreach/deploy/update.sh` on the Mumbai VM. Frontend already pushed; Vercel will auto-deploy. After both, browser-verify on `/companies/[category]` (sort dropdown should reshuffle results across all pages, not just current page) and on `/dashboard` (no "0 companies" flash before counts load).

### 2026-04-25 — VM backend deployed for stats + Apify status
- **What:** Fast-forwarded the Oracle VM checkout from the accidental `origin/local-backup` reset back to `origin/phase-4-pg`, restarted `pm2` app `outreach-backend`, and confirmed public backend health is `ok`.
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/backend/server.js:133](../outreach-local/backend/server.js#L133), [../outreach-local/backend/services/creditChecker.js:44](../outreach-local/backend/services/creditChecker.js#L44)
- **Status:** live VM is on `phase-4-pg` commit `f929862` for runtime code; `https://outreach-jt.duckdns.org/api/health` returned `{"status":"ok",...,"auth_mode":"enforce"}`.
- **Follow-up:** User should hard-refresh Vercel app and verify Companies contacts show total contact count/subtext and API Status marks Apify red or amber when quota/API failure is reported.

### 2026-04-25 — Backend deploy script corrected
- **What:** Fixed `deploy/update.sh` so future VM deploys fast-forward `origin/phase-4-pg` instead of resetting to `origin/local-backup`; dependency install now runs only when backend package files change and uses legacy peer handling for the existing OpenAI/Zod peer conflict.
- **Files:** [../outreach-local/deploy/update.sh:19](../outreach-local/deploy/update.sh#L19)
- **Status:** committed and pushed on `phase-4-pg`: `53f0767`; VM checkout also fast-forwarded to `53f0767`; `bash -n deploy/update.sh` passed; VM no-op deploy script run returned `Already up to date`.
- **Follow-up:** Future backend deploys can use `sudo bash /home/ubuntu/outreach/deploy/update.sh` again without rolling the VM back to `local-backup`.

### 2026-04-25 — Companies contacts count + Apify status
- **What:** Fixed misleading Companies/Dashboard contact stats by enriching frontend stats from job metrics and patched backend `/api/stats` to return total contacts plus email/LinkedIn counts. Wired API Status to `/api/credits/status` so Apify turns red on quota/error instead of green just because a token exists.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/api.js:70](frontend/src/api.js#L70), [frontend/src/components/CompanyDashboard.jsx:151](frontend/src/components/CompanyDashboard.jsx#L151), [frontend/src/App.jsx:130](frontend/src/App.jsx#L130), [../outreach-local/backend/server.js:133](../outreach-local/backend/server.js#L133), [../outreach-local/backend/services/creditChecker.js:44](../outreach-local/backend/services/creditChecker.js#L44)
- **Status:** frontend committed on `main`: `346c0b2`; backend committed on `phase-4-pg`: `f929862`; `npm run build --prefix frontend`, `node --check backend/server.js`, and `node --check backend/services/creditChecker.js` passed.
- **Follow-up:** Branches were pushed and VM backend was deployed later on 2026-04-25. Browser-verify after Vercel deploy.

### 2026-04-27 — Pre-launch hardening pushed (NOT YET DEPLOYED to VM)
- **What:** Phase 1–3 + 5 launch-blocker fixes per `PLAN-B.txt` walkthrough. Auth boot guard (refuses prod start without `AUTH_MODE=enforce`), 100/24h daily cap on `/auto-apply/run`, partial unique index on submitted evaluations, `auto_apply_paused` soft-pause flag, forgot-password flow + `/reset-password` route, US-only banner on Login, mobile-warning banner under 900px, `NIGHTLY_CRON_DISABLED` kill-switch on both crons, email stripped from auth logs, frontend code-split (728 KB → 235 KB main).
- **Files:** [backend/middleware/requireAuth.js](backend/middleware/requireAuth.js), [backend/routes/careerOps.js:443](backend/routes/careerOps.js#L443), [backend/server.js:445](backend/server.js#L445), [backend/services/nightlyPipeline.js:28](backend/services/nightlyPipeline.js#L28), [supabase/migrations/009_evaluations_unique_submitted.sql](supabase/migrations/009_evaluations_unique_submitted.sql), [supabase/migrations/010_auto_apply_paused.sql](supabase/migrations/010_auto_apply_paused.sql), [frontend/src/App.jsx](frontend/src/App.jsx), [frontend/src/components/Login.jsx](frontend/src/components/Login.jsx), [frontend/src/components/ResetPassword.jsx](frontend/src/components/ResetPassword.jsx), [frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx:670](frontend/src/components/CareerOps.jsx#L670), [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md), [scripts/verify-migrations.mjs](scripts/verify-migrations.mjs)
- **Status:** committed + pushed as `9692e11` on `main`; `npm run build --prefix frontend` passed; backend `node --check` passed on all four edited files. `/api/health` on the live VM still shows `auth_mode:"enforce"` from the existing deploy — code is on GitHub but **not yet pulled to the VM and not yet running**.
- **Follow-up:** User executes the runbook below to (1) apply migrations 009 + 010 in Supabase SQL editor, (2) `git pull` on the VM and `pm2 restart`, (3) confirm `/api/health` shows `nightly_cron_disabled:false` (proves new code is live), (4) end-to-end test forgot-password + the new pause toggle. Mobile-device QA still owed.

### 2026-04-25 — Ranked Roles blank page + Completed tab order
- **What:** Moved Auto Apply `Completed` tab after `History`. Hardened `/apply/ranked` against backend score values arriving as strings by normalizing `fit_score`, response shape, average score, best-match, and score rendering.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/components/AutoApplyPage.jsx:5](frontend/src/components/AutoApplyPage.jsx#L5), [frontend/src/components/CareerOpsPage.jsx:19](frontend/src/components/CareerOpsPage.jsx#L19)
- **Status:** committed and pushed on `main`: `0d0e534`; `npm run build --prefix frontend` passed; not yet browser-confirmed by user.
- **Follow-up:** After Vercel deploy, hard-refresh and verify `/apply/ranked` plus Auto Apply tab ordering.

### 2026-04-25 — Apply nav overlay fix pushed
- **What:** Pushed the sidebar overlay fix and handoff update to `origin/main`.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/App.jsx:210](frontend/src/App.jsx#L210), [HANDOFF.md:116](HANDOFF.md#L116)
- **Status:** pushed to `origin/main`; local branch matches remote except unrelated untracked files.
- **Follow-up:** Wait for Vercel deploy, hard-refresh the app, and retry the Apply nav items.

### 2026-04-25 — Apply sidebar clicks blocked by overlay
- **What:** User reported Apply nav items were not opening. Live Vercel routes returned 200 and the deployed JS contained the Apply routes, so patched the sidebar to sit above non-modal content overlays that can intercept clicks.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/App.jsx:210](frontend/src/App.jsx#L210)
- **Status:** committed and pushed on `main`: `fcb908b`; `npm run build --prefix frontend` passed; not yet browser-confirmed by user.
- **Follow-up:** After Vercel deploy, user should hard-refresh and retry `/apply/auto-apply`, `/apply/pipeline`, and `/apply/ranked`.

### 2026-04-25 — Push state revalidated
- **What:** Rechecked `git status`, `git log --oneline -6`, and `git push origin main` after a stale handoff said `main` was still 4 commits ahead. GitHub was already up to date.
- **Files:** [HANDOFF.md:38](HANDOFF.md#L38)
- **Status:** committed on `main` as a handoff-only update; unrelated untracked files remain: `PLAN-B.txt`, `supabase/migrations/002_backend_schema.sql`, `supabase/migrations/003_per_user_isolation.sql`.
- **Follow-up:** Browser-verify `/outreach` and `/apply/auto-apply` after Vercel deployment.

### 2026-04-25 — Main pushed after Auto Apply work
- **What:** Pushed `main` to GitHub after rebasing local Outreach/Completed/HANDOFF commits on top of the remote Phase C commit (`bfcea63`).
- **Files:** [HANDOFF.md:38](HANDOFF.md#L38)
- **Status:** pushed to `origin/main` through `bc996ce`; local worktree still has unrelated untracked files `PLAN-B.txt`, `supabase/migrations/002_backend_schema.sql`, and `supabase/migrations/003_per_user_isolation.sql`.
- **Follow-up:** Wait for Vercel deployment, then verify `/outreach` and `/apply/auto-apply` in browser.

### 2026-04-25 — Outreach fix committed + Phase C linearized onto main
- **What:** Committed the Outreach CRM JWT-fetch fix, then replayed local work on top of remote `main` after GitHub advanced to Phase C (`bfcea63`) during the session.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/components/OutreachPage.jsx:34](frontend/src/components/OutreachPage.jsx#L34), [HANDOFF.md:38](HANDOFF.md#L38)
- **Status:** committed and pushed on `main`: `8a55549`; Phase C is now in `main` via `bfcea63`; not browser-tested.
- **Follow-up:** Verify `/outreach` on the deployed Vercel app after deployment.

### 2026-04-25 — Auto Apply Completed tab
- **What:** Added a `Completed` tab to `/apply/auto-apply`. It reads `api.career.pipeline()`, filters `apply_status === 'submitted'`, and shows submitted roles sorted by applied date.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/components/AutoApplyPage.jsx:5](frontend/src/components/AutoApplyPage.jsx#L5), [frontend/src/components/AutoApplyPage.jsx:177](frontend/src/components/AutoApplyPage.jsx#L177)
- **Status:** committed and pushed on `main`: `b3bc61c`; `npm run build --prefix frontend` passed. Full `npm run lint --prefix frontend` still fails on pre-existing repo lint debt (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`, unused vars, empty catches, `vite.config.js` `__dirname`).
- **Follow-up:** Verify the Completed tab in browser after Vercel deploy.

### 2026-04-25 — Context refresh + memory confirmation
- **What:** Read `HANDOFF.md`, confirmed `MEMORY.md` and `feedback_keep_handoff_updated.md` are accessible, and checked frontend/backend worktree state.
- **Files:** [HANDOFF.md:1](HANDOFF.md#L1), `/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/.claude/projects/-Users-lakshmisravyarachakonda-VS-CODE-email-tracker/memory/MEMORY.md`, `/Users/lakshmisravyarachakonda/.claude/projects/-Users-lakshmisravyarachakonda-VS-CODE-email-tracker/memory/feedback_keep_handoff_updated.md`
- **Status:** included in `8a55549` after `HANDOFF.md` was added to git; backend worktree is on `phase-4-pg`.
- **Follow-up:** Keep appending dated entries before ending each unit of work.

### 2026-04-24 — Outreach CRM "0 contacts" root cause + fix
- **What:** `OutreachPage.jsx` was calling raw `fetch('/api/unified/all-contacts?…')` which bypassed the JWT-attaching `api.js` wrapper. Backend in `AUTH_MODE=enforce` returned 401; the `.then(r => r.ok ? r.json() : { contacts: [] })` handler silently swallowed it → empty list, no error UI. Swapped to `api.unified.allContacts(params)` which attaches `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` from the current Supabase session. Added `console.error` on failure so the next silent-empty case isn't silent. Swept the rest of `frontend/src` — this was the only naked `/api/` fetch.
- **Files:** [frontend/src/components/OutreachPage.jsx:34-44](frontend/src/components/OutreachPage.jsx#L34-L44)
- **Status:** uncommitted on `main`; NOT browser-tested yet; backend endpoint at [backend/routes/unified.js:285](../outreach-local/backend/routes/unified.js#L285) confirmed to accept `limit`/`hasEmail`/`noEmail` and scope by `req.user.id`.
- **Follow-up:** User to deploy and confirm `/outreach` as `lakshmisravyar@gmail.com` shows 36 contacts (14 with email). Then commit + push.

### 2026-04-24 — Branch-state discovery (blocker for Completed tab work)
- **What:** User asked to add a "Completed" tab to the Auto Apply page at `/apply/auto-apply`. Investigation revealed that page **does not exist on `main`** — it was introduced by commit `cbadab2` "Phase C: IA refactor — DISCOVER / APPLY / OUTREACH sections + Auto Apply page" which lives on remote branch `feat/ia-discover-apply-outreach`, not yet merged. The handoff's listed commit `bfcea63` for Phase C is not present in `git log --all`; handoff commit hashes for Phase C appear aspirational/stale.
- **Files:** n/a — investigation only. `git log main` tops at `3c5be1b`. `feat/ia-discover-apply-outreach` tip: `cbadab2`.
- **Status:** Blocked awaiting user decision: add Completed tab on `feat/ia-discover-apply-outreach` directly, or merge Phase C → main first then add on main. Also unclear what Vercel (`outreach-jt.vercel.app`) is tracking — screenshot shows Phase C live in prod, so either the feature branch is deployed or Phase C was rebased/pushed to main under a different hash.
- **Follow-up:** Next session — ask user which branch to land the Completed tab on. Per memory rule, do NOT switch branches with the OutreachPage.jsx fix still uncommitted without stashing first.
